# Chaquopy demo

This is the demo app of [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/), the Python SDK for Android. It includes the SDK's complete unit test suite, as well as a REPL (read-eval-print loop) for interactive experimentation.

For more details, see the [Chaquopy documentation](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/).

Please use the GitHub issue tracker to report issues with both the demo app and the SDK itself.
