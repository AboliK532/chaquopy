# Chaquopy demo

This is the demo app of [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/), the Python SDK for Android. It includes:

* A REPL (read-eval-print loop) for interactive experimentation.
* An example of an Android activity written entirely in Python.
* An example of how to use a Python library installed from PyPI in a normal Java activity.
* The SDK's complete unit test suite.

The project currently targets Android Studio 3.0, but should also be buildable with versions
2.2 and 2.3.

You can install a pre-built copy of this app from [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaquo.python.demo). Please use the
GitHub issue tracker to report issues with both the demo app and the SDK itself.

For more details, see the [Chaquopy website](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/).
