# Chaquopy demo

This is the demo app of [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/), the Python SDK for Android. It includes:

* A REPL (read-eval-print loop) for interactive experimentation.
* An example of an Android activity written entirely in Python.
* An example of how to use a Python library installed from PyPI in a normal Java activity.
* The SDK's complete unit test suite.

You can install a pre-built copy of this app from [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaquo.python.demo). Please use the GitHub issue tracker to report issues with both the demo app and the SDK itself.
